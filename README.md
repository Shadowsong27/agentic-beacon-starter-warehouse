# Your Organization Agentic Engineering Warehouse

Centralized repository for coding standards, knowledge, and skills used by AI agents across Your Organization.

Under the current Agentic Beacon model, this warehouse clone is the **single write entrypoint** for every harness artifact on a developer's machine. Projects reference it via per-file symlinks under `.agentic-beacon/artifacts/`. See [single-warehouse-write-entrypoint](knowledge/decisions/single-warehouse-write-entrypoint.md) if this document is scaffolded with that decision.

## Quick Start

### For Developers

```bash
# 1. Install the Agentic Beacon CLI (once per machine; macOS/Linux only)
uv tool install agentic-beacon

# 2. Clone this warehouse locally (stays on disk; projects symlink into it)
git clone <this-repo-url> ~/path/to/this-warehouse

# 3. In your project, connect to this warehouse
cd ~/my-project
abc warehouse connect --path ~/path/to/this-warehouse

# 4. Create your artifact config and sync
abc setup             # creates .agentic-beacon/beacon.yaml
abc adopt             # select relevant warehouse artifacts (including agents)
abc sync              # creates symlinks into the warehouse clone
```

### For Contributors

```bash
# Edit an artifact through any project's symlink (writes land in the warehouse working tree)
$EDITOR ~/my-project/.agentic-beacon/artifacts/knowledge/python/type-hints.md

# See what changed (scoped to your project's beacon.yaml)
abc warehouse status

# Commit and optionally push
abc warehouse contribute -m "python: clarify type hints" --push
```

Alternatively, edit files directly in the warehouse clone and commit with plain `git`.

After your changes are pushed, teammates pull the warehouse and the content is immediately visible through their existing project symlinks — no per-project `abc sync` required (unless `beacon.yaml` itself changed).

### Offline / Private Install

Download the bundle zip for your platform from the [Releases page](<releases-url>):

```bash
unzip agentic_beacon-X.Y.Z-bundle-<platform>.zip -d abc-bundle
uv tool install agentic-beacon --no-index --find-links ./abc-bundle/
```

## Structure

- **`contexts/`** — Boot instructions loaded by agents at session start
- **`knowledge/`** — Atomic decisions, lessons, and facts organized by scope
- **`skills/`** — Reusable workflows and procedures (agent slash commands)
- **`agents/`** — Project-scoped sub-agent profiles wired via `abc adopt` / `abc sync`
- **`docs/`** — Warehouse documentation and contribution guides

## CLI Reference

| Command | Description |
